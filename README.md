# About PawFinder 

PawFinder is a compassionate and user-friendly responsive web app dedicated to addressing the heart-wrenching issue of lost pets. At the heart of PawFinder is a contemporary web development stack, combining the power of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to craft an interface. In the backend, I've used PHP to ensure the secure handling of data, and I rely on the reliability of a MySQL database to safeguard the precious information collected. The result is a web app that offers a seamless and optimized viewing experience on a wide range of devices, including desktop computers, tablets, and mobile phones. Whether you're searching for a lost pet from the comfort of your home or on the go, PawFinder is there to assist.

PawFinder is more than just technology; it's a movement, a collective effort to bring solace and joy back to pet owners who have lost their cherished companions. I understand the deep distress that comes with a lost pet, and my platform is designed to streamline the process of reuniting them with their loving families. It's a digital space where empathy and support thrive.
